# game-server

- This repo contains all the server-side code for the game (dubbed Maze Runner) that I am creating.
- This repo is meant to be used in conjunction with the game-client repo.
- In the application's current state, we have the play-with-friend, play-with-random lobby mechanisms, random maze generation, player movement working.
- The game is going to be multiplayer and that is achieved through the use of socket.io

# Instructions for use
- Clone both this and the client repo
- Open the directories and run 'npm install' in both of them to download all dependencies
- Run 'npm start' in both directories to launch the app
- By default, the app will be accessible through http://localhost:3000
