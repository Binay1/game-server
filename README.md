# game-server

- This repo contains all the server-side code for the game that I am creating.
- This repo is meant to be used with the game-client repo.
- In the application's current state, we have the play-with-friend, random maze generation mechanisms working.
- The game is going to be multiplayer and all the code for that is written using socket.io
